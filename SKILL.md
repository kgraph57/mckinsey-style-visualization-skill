# McKinsey/BCG Style Visualization

**Professional consulting-style data visualization and infographics creation skill for strategic analysis and executive presentations.**

---

## Overview

This skill enables the creation of high-density, professional consulting presentation slides and data visualizations in the style of top-tier strategy firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain). The output combines institutional authority with editorial financial-report aesthetics, designed for boardroom-ready executive presentations.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating strategic analysis presentations for executive audiences
- Developing competitive benchmarking visualizations
- Building data-driven consulting deliverables
- Designing market analysis infographics
- Producing high-information-density business reports
- Visualizing complex strategic frameworks and comparisons

**Do NOT use for:**
- Marketing materials or promotional content
- Startup pitch decks with bright colors
- Decorative or artistic visualizations
- Low-information-density slides

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Strategic Framing (Mandatory)

Every visualization must be **hypothesis-driven, not descriptive**.

**Requirements:**
- State a clear, insight-led headline that answers a strategic question directly
- Every section must drive toward a specific strategic implication
- Avoid neutral comparison — highlight structural trade-offs, capability gaps, competitive moats, and strategic asymmetries
- The visualization should implicitly support an executive-level decision (e.g., invest, partner, build, acquire, differentiate)

**Bad Example:** "Comparison of AI Video Models"
**Good Example:** "Temporal Consistency Emerges as the Key Differentiator in GenAI Video — Seedance 2.0 Leads on Technical Benchmarks but Lags on Ecosystem Integration"

---

### 2. Visual & Design Standards

#### Aesthetic
- **Tech-minimalist but information-heavy**
- Clean, sharp, authoritative
- Institutional and boardroom-ready
- **NOT** startup-style or decorative

#### Typography

**For Cover Slides:**
- **Main Title:** Serif font (Times New Roman / Georgia / Playfair Display / Libre Baskerville)
  - Size: Very large (48-72pt equivalent)
  - Weight: Regular or Medium (not bold - maintains elegance)
  - Color: White `#FFFFFF`
- **Subtitle:** Sans-serif (Inter / Helvetica / Arial)
  - Size: Medium (18-24pt equivalent)
  - Weight: Light or Regular
  - Color: Light Grey `#E5E7EB`
- **Metadata:** Sans-serif (Inter / Helvetica / Arial)
  - Size: Small (10-12pt equivalent)
  - Weight: Light
  - Color: Light Grey `#E5E7EB`

**For Content Slides:**
- **Headlines:** Serif (Times New Roman / Georgia)
  - Size: Large (24-36pt equivalent)
  - Weight: Bold
  - Color: Black `#000000`
- **Body Text:** Sans-serif (Inter / Helvetica / Arial)
  - Size: Medium (14-16pt equivalent)
  - Weight: Regular
  - Color: Dark Grey `#374151`
- **Data Labels:** Sans-serif (Inter / Helvetica / Arial / Roboto)
  - Size: Small-Medium (12-14pt equivalent)
  - Weight: Medium or Semibold
  - Color: Black `#000000` or Deep Royal Blue `#1E3A8A`
- **Emphasis:** Bold for key numbers and strategic insights

#### Color Palette

**For Content Slides (Data Visualizations):**
- **Background:** Pure White `#FFFFFF`
- **Primary Text:** Sharp Black `#000000`
- **Primary Accent:** Deep Royal Blue `#1E3A8A`
- **Secondary Accent:** Medium Blue `#2563EB`
- **Grey Hierarchy:**
  - Dark Grey (primary text): `#374151`
  - Medium Grey (secondary text): `#6B7280`
  - Light Grey (borders/dividers): `#D1D5DB`
  - Very Light Grey (subtle backgrounds): `#F3F4F6`

**For Cover Slides:**
- **Background:** Deep Navy Blue `#1E3A5F`
- **Alternative Background:** Gradient from `#1E3A5F` to `#2C4A6F`
- **Primary Text:** Pure White `#FFFFFF`
- **Secondary Text:** Light Grey `#E5E7EB`
- **Optional Accent:** Subtle Gold `#D4AF37` (for premium touch, use sparingly)

**General Rules:**
- **NO gradients** on content slides (only subtle gradients allowed on cover slides)
- **NO bright startup colors** (avoid neon, pastels, or vibrant hues)

#### Graphic Rules
- **Hairline borders** for tables (thin, precise lines)
- **Precise vector lines** for charts and frameworks
- **NO decorative icons** (use functional icons only when necessary)
- **NO visual clutter** (every element must serve a purpose)

---

### 3. Aspect Ratio Standards

**CRITICAL: Always use landscape (horizontal) orientation for consistency.**

**Recommended aspect ratios:**
- **Landscape (16:9):** Default for all visualizations — ensures consistency across slides
- **Landscape (3:2):** Alternative for wider layouts

**Avoid:**
- Portrait orientation (unless specifically requested)
- Square formats (unless for specific use cases like social media)

**Rationale:**
- Landscape orientation is standard for business presentations
- Maintains visual consistency when multiple charts are used together
- Optimized for screen sharing and projection
- Easier to read in document formats

```

**General prompt engineering tips:**
- Always specify "landscape 16:9 format" at the beginning
- Always specify "white background" for content slides, "deep navy blue background" for cover slides
- Always specify "serif headline in bold" for content slides
- Always include exact hex codes for colors
- Always emphasize "clean, minimal, institutional aesthetic"
- Always add "No gradients, no decorative elements" at the end for content slides
- Use specific data points and labels from your analysis
- Include strategic insight in the headline

---

## Workflow

1. **Define the strategic question** — What decision does this visualization support?
2. **Choose the visualization type** — Select from the 11 types above
3. **Draft the insight-driven headline** — Make it hypothesis-driven, not descriptive
4. **Gather and structure data** — Organize data points, labels, and annotations
5. **Select the prompt template** — Use the appropriate template from above
6. **Customize the prompt** — Fill in your specific data, headline, and insights
7. **Generate the visualization** — Use image generation tools with the customized prompt
8. **Review and refine** — Check against the quality checklist below

---

## Language Considerations

**Default language: English**

While this skill can be used in Japanese or other languages, **English is strongly recommended** for the following reasons:

1. **Font rendering:** Image generation models handle English typography more reliably
2. **Consistency:** Serif/sans-serif font pairing works better in English
3. **Readability:** Latin characters render more clearly at small sizes
4. **International audience:** English is standard for global business presentations

**If Japanese is required:**
- Use sans-serif fonts only (avoid serif for Japanese text)
- Increase font sizes for better readability
- Test rendering quality before finalizing
- Be prepared for potential issues:
  - Font substitution
  - Character spacing problems
  - Inconsistent font rendering

**Best practice:** Use English for all text in visualizations, then provide Japanese translations in accompanying documents if needed.

---

## Multi-Visualization Projects

When creating multiple visualizations for a single project:

1. **Maintain consistent aspect ratio** — Use landscape for all charts
2. **Use the same color palette** — Deep royal blue, greys, white, black
3. **Apply consistent typography** — Serif for headlines, sans-serif for data
4. **Align visual density** — Similar level of information across all charts
5. **Create a visual hierarchy** — Most important insights first

**Batch generation:**
- Generate up to 5 images per batch using image generation tools
- Ensure all images in a batch use the same aspect ratio
- Review all images for consistency before delivering

---

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering any visualization, verify:

- [ ] **Aspect ratio:** Landscape orientation used
- [ ] **Color palette:** White background, black text, royal blue accents, no gradients (for content slides)
- [ ] **Typography:** Serif headline, sans-serif data labels
- [ ] **Data accuracy:** All numbers, percentages, and labels are correct
- [ ] **Strategic insight:** Headline is insight-driven, not descriptive
- [ ] **Visual clarity:** No clutter, every element serves a purpose
- [ ] **Annotations:** Key insights and context provided
- [ ] **Consistency:** If multiple charts, all follow same design system
- [ ] **Language:** English used to avoid rendering issues (unless Japanese explicitly requested)
